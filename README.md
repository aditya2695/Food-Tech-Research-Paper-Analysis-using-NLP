# Food Tech Research Paper Analysis using NLP


This project focuses on analyzing research papers in the food technology sector using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to extract insights from the research papers and present them through a dashboard in Tableau. The analysis includes techniques such as Named Entity Recognition (NER), topic modeling, and sentiment analysis.
Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis consists of approximately 5000 journal articles within the food technology sector. Each article contains metadata including authors, journal, year, and abstract. The abstracts are the main focus of the analysis, as they provide valuable information about the research topics and findings.


# Techniques Used

### Named Entity Recognition (NER)

Named Entity Recognition is a technique in NLP that aims to identify and classify named entities in text. In this project, NER is applied to the abstracts of the research papers to extract important entities such as ingredients, food products, techniques, and more. The entities are labeled and used to gain insights into the key topics and trends in the food technology domain.

### Topic Modeling

Topic modeling is a powerful technique for uncovering latent topics or themes in a collection of documents. In this project, topic modeling is applied to the abstracts of the research papers to identify and extract underlying topics. This helps in understanding the major research areas and trends within the food technology sector.

### Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment analysis is the process of determining the sentiment or opinion expressed in a piece of text. In this project, sentiment analysis is performed on the abstracts of the research papers to gauge the overall sentiment towards various food technologies or research findings. This provides insights into the general sentiment and attitudes within the field.

### Dashboard Visualization

The insights derived from the NER, topic modeling, and sentiment analysis are visualized through a dashboard created in Tableau. The dashboard provides an interactive and user-friendly interface to explore and understand the findings of the analysis. It includes visualizations such as word clouds, topic distributions, sentiment analysis summaries, and more.

### Conclusion

Through this research paper analysis using NLP techniques, we aim to provide valuable insights into the food technology sector. By leveraging NER, topic modeling, and sentiment analysis, we can uncover key entities, topics, and sentiments from the research papers. The dashboard in Tableau serves as a comprehensive visualization tool to explore and understand the analysis results.

This project demonstrates the power of NLP in extracting meaningful information from large volumes of text data and provides researchers, industry professionals, and stakeholders in the food technology domain with valuable insights to drive innovation and decision-making.
